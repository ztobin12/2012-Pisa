# PISA 2012 Visualization
## by Zack Tobinztobin12

## Dataset
This project explores the Program for International Student Assesment PISA (2012) dataset. PISA is survey that tests students around the world, not just on their ability to understand the school curriculum, but on how prepared they are for life after school.

## Summary of Findings

What I was mainly interested in seeing was how much a student studies impacts their test scores in Math, Reading, and Science compared to how wealthy thier upringing was. What I found was that while there is a positive correlation between how hard one studies and their test scores,(most notably, students in Shanghai study more than any other area, and also score the best), there is a far stronger correlation between high test scores being wealthy. Interestingly, there was actually slight negative correlation between how wealthy they are and how may hours they study per week. This is largely because less wealthy students are less likely to have access to resources like Textbooks and internet at school, which in turn makes it harder to get a proper education.
